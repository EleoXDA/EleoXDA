I am coming from XDA Developers Forum. I am advanced in QA and Junior in Android Development. I have edited several apps and have worked with custom ROM/firmware for several devices.

- I know Bash and XML. I’m currently working on expanding my programming knowledge in Java and Kotlin for Android Studio, and Dart for Flutter.
- My next stop is learning Swift for iOS development.
- I’m looking to collaborate on mobile developments like iOS and Android apps.
